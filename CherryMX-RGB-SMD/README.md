CherryMX-RGB-SMD: Breakout-Board for a single MX-Type Switch with SMD Backlighting. A Diode on the Back allows for "Ghostless" Operation. A 1-Wire EEPROM could enable Autodetection of different Switches/LEDs as well as Analog Input Devices.

The EEPROM is powered by the Row(3.3V) and Column(GND), because of this the Boards location in the Matrix can be determined despite the EEPROMs Address being fixed.
