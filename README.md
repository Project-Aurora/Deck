# Deck
Breakout Boards for 64-Pin ARM MCUs, Keyswitches and IS31FL3732

# Components
+	MCU: The Microcontroller including one IS31FL3732 and a hot-pluggable Power-Connector (either Barrel Jack or MicroUSB)
+	Chain-Connector: Adds the Possibility to Connect two Devices over UART, an additional Master Pin enables automatic Crossover.
+	CherryMX-RGB: Breakout-Board for a single MX-Type Switch with either SMD or THT Backlighting. A Diode on the Back allows for "Ghostless" Operation. A 1-Wire EEPROM could enable Autodetection of different Switches/LEDs as well as Analog Input Devices.
+	LED-Driver: Breakout-Board for one IS31FL3732. These Boards are Chainable, the Device-Address can be freely assigned using external Connections. The Number of Boards can be enumerated using A/D-Conversion on chained Resistors.
